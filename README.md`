Hi, I am Prince! I can solve almost all data-related agonies!!! I am skilled in Python, SQL, NoSQL, Power BI, Tableau, SSRS, SSIS, and Power Automate. I have solved business problems using Data Analytics, ETL and Data Wrangling.

I work as a Data Analyst with US Healthcare and here are my humble contributions:

=> Identified major KPIs for hospitals which in turn, have helped healthcare systems to assess their performance.

=> Created multiple healthcare-related dashboards with automated refresh and continuous data feed leading to a reduction in manual data extraction workload. These dashboards helped to identify the percentage of missing data in the database which is critical for proper diagnosis

=> Forecasted drug demand for pharmacy concerning specific drugs, hence, cutting down the overall purchase cost as well as reducing the drug wastage.

=> Optimized stored procedures and queries, cutting down the report run time.

I am more data-informed than data-driven. I want my data to tell stories that are relatable, understandable, and actionable which would aid data-informed business decisions.

If all of this sounds interesting to you and you are wondering if I would be good fit for your business, letâ€™s talk!
